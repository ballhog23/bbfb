# Bleed Blue Fantasy Football

Thanks to the Sleeper team for having a free API to help us keep track of the history and current state of our league.
If the Sleeper API is ever retired the league will still have access to historical data that could be used elsewhere.

## Project Scope

The goal of this project is to learn how to better manage 3rd party data.
Database design, and data integrity is the main focus.
Ensuring that incoming data from Sleeper is in the shape we expect.
Integrate with AWS services such as EventBridge, Lambda, EC2 or Lightsail (haven't decided), AWS VPC, S3, CF
